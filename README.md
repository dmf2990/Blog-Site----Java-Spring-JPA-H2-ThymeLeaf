This project is our first exploration into the spring MVC model.
We focused on learning how to build controllers, and render dynamic web pages using ThymeLeaf.  
Our data bases were handled using JPA and H2.
We focused on the ability to add posts, add categories of posts, and then add authors and tags to individual posts. 
We can then search for posts by author and posts by a specific tag. 

Our front end still needs to be fully integrated, but the functionality is all working in full.
