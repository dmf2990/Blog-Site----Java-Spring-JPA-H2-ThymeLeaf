This project is our first exploration into the spring MVC model. Thus, our login page is a mock page as we have not let learned to implement new users / specfic users. You can still click the menu in the top left to see all posts, add a new post, add a new author, and add a new tag. The all post page still needs to be completed (front end only) to ensure visually appealing site.
We focused on learning how to build controllers, models, repositories, using H2 & JPA, and rendering dynamic web pages using ThymeLeaf.  
Our data bases were handled using JPA and H2.
We focused on the ability to add posts, add categories of posts, and then add authors and tags to individual posts. 
We can then search for posts by author and posts by a specific tag. 

Our front end still needs to be fully integrated, but the functionality is all working in full.
