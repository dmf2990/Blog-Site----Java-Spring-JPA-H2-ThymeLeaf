## Spring Thymeleaf Project

This project is our first exploration into the spring MVC model (run master branch). Thus, our login page is a mock page as we have not let learned to implement new users / specfic users. You can still click the menu in the top left to see all posts, add a new post, add a new author, and add a new tag. The all post page still needs to be completed (front end only) to ensure visually appealing site.

## Dependencies used
    compile("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf")
    compile("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web")
    compile('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jpa')
    runtime('com.h2database:h2')

## Instructions for use 

Run application as Java project. Navigate to `localhost:8080/`

We focused on learning how to build controllers, models, repositories, using H2 & JPA, and rendering dynamic web pages using ThymeLeaf.  

### What I really like?

This project is our first exploration into the spring MVC model.  It was amazing to see how to dynamically render an HTML page using ThymeLeaf, as before this, we were only familiar with console projects (and not authorized to use any front end technologies).
